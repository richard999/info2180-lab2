   <p> Stay humble.
     Although it’s important to include your accomplishments and your experience,<br>
      do so in a reasonable manner, avoiding outlandish statements.<br>
      Declarations like, “I’m the best marketing professional there is” <br>
      or “Any company that brings me on board is lucky to have me” <br>
       will certainly hurt you more than it will help you get hired.<br> </p>

    <p>Pride and arrogance, which also cover smugness, snobbery, and vanity, are unpleasant words.<br>
     It can sometimes be hard to avoid feeling a bit proud of ourselves, or vain, or even snobbish.<br>
      It is often quite pleasant to feel like that, for example, if we have done something good,<br>
       and everyone is praising us. However, we tend not to call these feelings by name,<br>
    because the words themselves carry negative connotations. </p>

  <p>  Once you have an idea of what you spend in a month, <br> 
 you can begin to organize your recorded expenses into a workable budget. <br> 
 Your budget should outline how your expenses measure up to your income <br>
 so you can plan your spending and limit overspending.<br> 
 Be sure to factor in expenses that occur regularly but not every month, such as car maintenance. 
  </p>
